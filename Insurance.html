  <p> <b>Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) </b><br>
HMOs require primary care provider (PCP) referrals and won’t pay for care received out-of-network except in emergencies.2 
Cigna. What's the difference between an HMO, EPO, and PPO? 
 However, they tend to have lower monthly premiums than plans that offer similar benefits but come with fewer network restrictions. <br><br>
 
 
<b>Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) </b><br>
Preferred provider organizations are called that name because they have a network of providers they prefer that you use, but they’ll still pay for out-of-network care. Given that they’re less restrictive than most other plan types, they tend to have higher monthly premiums and sometimes require higher cost-sharing. <br><br>
 
<b>Exclusive Provider Organization (EPO)</b><br>
EPOs got that name because they have a network of providers they use exclusively. You must stick to providers on that list or the EPO won’t pay. However, an EPO generally won't make you get a referral from a primary care healthcare provider in order to visit a specialist.6 Think of an EPO as similar to a PPO but without coverage for out-of-network care. <br><br>
 
<b>Point of Service (POS)</b><br>
POS plans resemble HMOs but are less restrictive in that you’re allowed, under certain circumstances, to get care out-of-network as you would with a PPO.7 Like HMOs, many POS plans require you to have a PCP referral for all care whether it’s in or out-of-network. <br><br>
 
<b>Indemnity Plans</b><br>
For reference, non-managed care plans are called indemnity plans. These are health plans that don't have provider networks and simply reimburse a portion of your charges for any covered medical service.
